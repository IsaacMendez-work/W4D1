JavaScript Group Project
	As a team decide on one of these three options:
	1. Tip Calculator
		Minimum requirements - total bill, number of guests, and quality of service
	2. Card Game (examples include memory game, high/low, war)
		Minimum requirements - max number of cards, how to calculate identical numerical card (hint: suit), reset button
	3. To Do List
		Minimum requirements - add an entry, remove an entry, mark entry as complete

	Create a brief proposal of what the team plans to include in the project. A checklist will be fine.
	Be sure to implement the topics you have learned in class up to this point.
	If you choose to implement additional code that has not been covered in class, be sure the entire team agrees and seek prior approval from the instructor/TA.
	You must include HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    Primitive data types, objects, arrays, this keyword at a minimum and then be creative and include OOP!
